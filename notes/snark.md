Open data business applications tend to fall into two camps. One is open data business as government contractor or privatization of what could be a government service--e.g., providing software to governments to help them share open data, or selling a transit app that saves the transit authority money because they no longer have to build it themselves. The other is open data as augmentation to private industry--combining government data with proprietary data to produce analysis (for internal business use or sold to others--companies, individuals, etc).

As far as business pursuits go, this isn't necessarily any worse than others. I absolutely support the idea that it shouldn't be done for free. It makes sense that people would want to charge money for using refined skills to perform the service of rendering something messy, confusing, or technical into something clear and easy to understand. That's basically what journalists do all the time. However, the rhetoric around open data as an asset to private industry is at times disconcerting in its framing of civic life as consumer choice and its apparent confusion of *open* for *free*. 

In a recent *Forbes* article on the NYU GovLab's recently released Open Data 500 Index, GovLab director Beth Simone Noveck outlines the multitude of applications for open data:

> With huge advances in data science, we can take this data and turn it into tools that help people choose a safer hospital, pick a better place to live, improve the performance of their farm or business by having better climate models, and know more about the companies with whom they are doing business. Done right, people can even contribute data back, giving everyone a better understanding, for example of nuclear contamination in post-Fukushima Japan or incidences of price gouging in America’s inner cities.

Rather than, say, using data to better allocate funding or other resources toward improving hospitals and neighborhoods across the board, access to data and market forces will do away with those less desirable hospitals and neighborhoods. Eventually, we might not even need government to be responsible for collecting data--we can crowdsource it instead! Maybe those [Census bureau budget cuts](http://directorsblog.blogs.census.gov/2013/06/19/census-bureau-budget-update-2/) aren't such a big deal after all. And I'm sure there's a startup somewhere that's figured out a great way to collect all those crowdsourced responses--which is fine if you assume the crowd will respond and you don't mind having essentially zero quality control with your data.
