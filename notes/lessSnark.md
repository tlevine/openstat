#Open Data Metrics: Seeing the Forest for the Trees

The inherent value of open data in the United States is increasingly not a matter of debate. Governments, journalists, activists, businesses, and plain old citizens like it. They want it. They want more of it. But while agreement is coalescing around open data's value, it's still unclear how to measure that value. Ironically, there isn't a singular standard of measurement for massive collections of, well, publicly available collections of standardized measurements of things.

In *Seeing Like a State*, anthropologist James C. Scott describes different metrics-establishing practices that render states "legible"--taking informal local traditions and, by codifying or replacing them with standardized practices, creating a framework for the state to be fiscally, socially, and spatially comprehensible and controllable. Open data is, essentially, a state legibility instrument in the process of dramatic transformation through its increased public accessibility. 

Scott recounts the history of scientific forestry in the late 1700s as an example of the impact of prioritizing specific metrics: 

>Lurking behind the number indicating revenue yield were not so much forests as commercial wood, representing so many thousands of board feet of saleable timber and so many cords of firewood fetching a certain price. Missing, of course, were...all those parts of trees, even revenue-bearing trees, which might have been useful to the population but whose value could not be converted into fiscal receipts...foliage and its uses as fodder and thatch; fruits...twigs and branches...bark and roots..sap...and so on....In state "fiscal forestry", however, the actual tree with its vast number of possible uses was replaced by an abstract tree representing a volume of lumber or firewood. 

While this strategy was initially tremendously successful in creating an fiscally legible forest, it also created a monoculture--which, as Scott notes, "are, as a rule, more fragile and hence more vulnerable to the stress of disease and weather than polycultures are."

"Open" anything has come to signify a certain moral high ground, its political neutrality born of well-documented (or at least accessible) technical practices that Get Things Done. But the history of metrics is a history of politics, and the political implications of open data change dramatically depending on the metrics in play. Understanding how different open data metrics prioritize different applications and who benefits from those metrics is crucial to understanding--and protecting--the complex ecology of open data. 

**Open Data Economic Metrics**

The open data metric with the most hype at the moment is, unsurprisingly, the economic one. According to McKinsey's report **details here augh**, open data is "worth" $3 trillion in business opportunities. 

Open data business applications tend to fall into two camps. One is open data business as government contractor or privatization of what could be a government service--e.g., providing software to governments to help them share open data, or selling a transit app that saves the transit authority money because they no longer have to build it themselves. The other is open data as augmentation to private industry--combining government data with proprietary data to produce analysis (for internal business use or sold to others--companies, individuals, etc).

The idea of businesses taking advantage of public resources isn't exactly a radical idea--public highways are a great for business innovation, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a company (yes, even a tech company) that didn't benefit from them, but there isn't much reporting on innovators strategically using "open roads." And it makes sense that people would want to charge money for the highly skilled service of rendering something messy, confusing, or technical into something clear and easy to understand. That's basically what journalists do all the time. But it is somewhat disconcerting to see so much hype and so much energy placed around open data as private-sector boon when the applications most often proposed and implemented tend to emphasize it as an instrument for *consumer choice* as opposed to *civic resources*.

In a *Forbes* article on the NYU GovLab's recently released Open Data 500 Index, GovLab director Beth Simone Noveck outlines the multitude of applications for open data:

> With huge advances in data science, we can take this data and turn it into tools that help people choose a safer hospital, pick a better place to live, improve the performance of their farm or business by having better climate models, and know more about the companies with whom they are doing business. 

In these examples, data isn't really a resource for making decisions that can improve hosptials or neighborhoods across the board--that's a policy approach. Instead, access to data and market forces will determine which hosptials and which neighborhoods thrive. Or, perhaps if it is used toward informing policy decisions, that work is done by third-party solutioneers hired by government. 

Open data makes a ton of sense as a business resource because it's perceived as *free* because it costs no money to *access* the data. But open data actually *does* cost a lot of money to accumulate, distribute, and maintain, and that money comes from taxpayers. Ironically, the metrics for open data's economic value don't tend to factor this cost into their measurements.  In a [recent article for Counterpunch](http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/01/07/how-google-become-one-of-americas-biggest-tax-dodgers/), Darwin BondGraham noted the disparity between the benefits Google has received from public datasets and their efforts to avoid paying for them. If anything, companies that have the resources to most aggressively leverage public datasets are also companies that have the resources to aggressively avoid the taxation that pays for it. This seems like a dangerous business strategy, as it contributes to undermining the very resource that makes the business so profitable. 

**Open Data Civic Measures**

Steve Romulewski describes his career in open data as beginning in 1974, when the Freedom of Information Act was first passed. Romulewski comes from the school of thought that open data's best metric is when it helps people understand "how government works." This, hypothetically, can help make government work better. 

**Open Data Meta-Measures**

One benefit of open data argued by both private and public sector advocates is that access to more data leads to improved capacity to make data-driven decisions. But are decisions about open data data-driven? And what can be learned from open data metadata? 

Thomas Levine is probably not the only person doing this kind of research, though he may be the most dogged about it. It's unclear whether he's actually trying to destroy proprietary open data software companies or should be hired by them immediately. He's been scraping metadata from open data portals of municipal and state governments and analyzing it. By looking at data about dead links, pricing rates,  understand what's in public datasets, whether it's actually living up to the still-inchoate best practices standards for open data, and whether anyone's actually using it. 

His conclusion? "Nobody actually knows what is going on with open data."
