#Here are some notes about public open data and metrics

##Ways of Measuring and Valuing Public Open Data

**Disclaimer**: Asking about the value of public open data is actually asking a couple of other questions, which are *who* is using it and *what* they want to use it for.

###Economic Measure
**Who uses this measure**: Consulting firms, think tanks, people who really, really want to make money off of open data. 

**What it measures**: The ability of private industry to leverage open data towards business uses. 

**Implications**: It makes sense that people would want to charge money for using refined skills to perform the service of rendering something messy, confusing, or technical into something clear and easy to understand. That's basically what journalists do all the time. However, the rhetoric around open data as an asset to private industry is at times disconcerting in its framing of civic life as consumer choice and its apparent confusion of *open* for *free*. 

###Anecdotal Measure (Case Studies)
**Who uses this measure**: Think tanks and policy groups like the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org/case-studies), open data initiatives of government agencies using open data ([here are some examples](http://project-open-data.github.io/#case-studies)).

**What it measures**: What people did with open data in a specific context and why it was useful. Observes how the "open-ness" of open data contributes to civil society, to public life, or to helping agencies do their jobs. 

**Implications**: Using case studies as a way to measure open data's impact recognizes a certain irreconcilable reality of data-driven policy: sometimes things are really complicated and contextual, and they can't be understood merely as data points. Implementing "accountability" in one context might mean something else in another context. Accountability is generally measured through extraordinary circumstances that arise after an absence thereof. 

###Metadata Measure
**Who uses this measure**: Currently, apparently, only Thomas Levine. Metadata measurements are sometimes cited in agency case studies as evidence of impact (e.g. "XYZ API keys were registered in the first X months!")

**What it measures**: Primarily uses of open data in the context of government data portals--actual accessing of data, amount of data available, data formats, etc. 

**Implications**: This 


###Application Measure
**Who uses this measure**: Governments, mainly, also third-party contractors hired to do this for governments

**What it measures**: If and how the data is actually applied in making decisions about building schools, repairing power lines, scheduling trains, and all kinds of boring useful choices.

**Implications**: This is essentially what governments do with data all the time. Those measures, and conversations about them, are mostly relevant to measuring the impact of open data by comparing those methods against what is happening outside of government.
