Beth talks up the GovLab and then people expect it to be more than it is





Someone suggested that, rather than writing an article about the Open Data 500,
we should convey our thoughts on it to the Governance Lab in order that they
understand what they need to fix about it. We have told them, but this way of
thinking about it misses the point.

We don't particularly care about the outcome of the Open Data 500, but we find
it interesting that it is turning out the way it is. Open data is framed as a
noble cause, one that many a volunteer "civic hacker" will devote substantial
work towards, but initiatives in this area are still driven by ego (and not by data).








To us, the Open Data 500 was a waste of time, but someone wanted to do it, and
those desires are legitimate even if they seem strange.
